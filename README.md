# Curvetopia_Solution
It is a problem statement given in the Adobe GenSolve Hack-A-Thon in 2024. It's aim is to identify, regularize and beautify curves in 2D Euclidean space. Weâ€™ll start by focusing on closed curves and progressively work with more complex shapes. This project will also cover symmetry and curve completion techniques.
